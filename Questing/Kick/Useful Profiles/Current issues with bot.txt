Kick's Up-To-Date QQ List with Buddywing Bot for SWToR:


==========
Behaviors:
==========
UseObject (with hotspots) - sometimes it sits there trying to reuse the same object over and over even with a manual blacklist 60 (BlacklistDuration="60").  IE: Dark - Strength of 
UseObject - I need a UseTimes="" (use this many times consecutively).  Default 1 / or a usetwiceinarow function
UseObject - I need a UseOnce and GTFO type of function. If you do UseObject QID 1 ... the bitch keeps re-using the Object
UseObject - UO is not waiting the WaitTime (in seconds) after using an object
UseObject - needs a 'Go to XYZ and then attempt to use object' function (true / false - default false = current behavior) - Useful for a lot of quests where I have to put a lot of moveto's to make shit work
UseObject - needs a 'do not path to object' function (after going to hotspot)
PullDistance - I need a Pulldistance behavior - PullDistance="#"

Conditions - If something is empty, skip it... ie: if condition = true > </if> ... the bot will stall if there's nothing inside

Pulling - the bot needs to stop pulling yellow mobs


==========
Mesh:
==========
bot runs into lots of game objects (for useobject quests)
various buildings are not on the mesh (hopefully remeshing will fix this) 
various elevators are not on the mesh; or some that are - are not working properly (will QQ about this in skype)
